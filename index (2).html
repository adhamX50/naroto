    <h1>advandage and dis-advandage non-renewable</h1>
    <p>Energy exists freely in nature. Some of these are infinitely available in our surrounding and termed as renewable. Other are termed as non-renewable. It is our responsibility to make sure the proper use of both types of renewable and non-renewable energy. Non-renewable energy is available in limited quantity and eventually, these will run out over the time frame. In simple words, we can say that Non-renewable energy resources cannot renew themselves at a sufficient rate.
        Non-renewable energy comes from the sources which will run out or will not be replenished soon and easily. Mostly non-renewable energy sources are fossil fuels like coal, petroleum, and natural gases. Carbon is the main element in such fossil fuels. Due to this fact, fossil fuels are called as the Carboniferous Period.  All the fossil fuels formed in a similar way. Hundreds of millions of years ago, Earth was having a different landscape. These were covered with wide, shallow seas and swampy forests.
Plants, algae, and plankton grew in all those ancient wetlands. They absorbed the sunlight and further created energy through photosynthesis. When they died, the organisms drifted to the bottom of the sea or lake afterwards. There was the energy stored in the plants as well as in the animals when they died.
Over the passage of time, the dead plants were crushed under the seabed. Rocks and other sediment piled above them, creating high heat and pressure underground. In such an environment, the plant and animal remain eventually turned into fossil fuels. At present, there are huge underground pockets means reservoirs of these non-renewable sources of energy all over the world. </p>
